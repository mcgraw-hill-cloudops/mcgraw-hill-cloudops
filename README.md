## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mcgraw-hill-cloudops

I'm a bot account leveraged by the _CloudOps & Engineering_ team at [McGraw Hill](https://github.com/mheducation) for automation and other interesting things.

We're always looking for people who:

* Are smart
* Think like an owner
* Have a bias for taking action
* Want build and manage services used by all of our engineering teams
* Are software engineers first
* Are cloud-native
* Care about security-by-default
* Want to make an impact on education

If this sounds interesting to you, please reach out with your GitHub profile and a link to your rÃ©sumÃ©! We do a lot of cool things that haven't been made public yet, and we absolutely want people who can help us develop our open-source program into something great.
